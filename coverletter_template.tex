	To whom it may concern,\\
	
	My name is Jesse Franklin, I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Vermont under the supervision of Taylor Dupuy and Christelle Vincent. My research areas are Number Theory, and Algebraic Geometry, AMS Subject Classification numbers \textbf{[11]} (primary interest) and \textbf{[14]} (secondary interest). Currently, I am an adjunct faculty member at Salt Lake Community College
	
	I am applying for the position of \todo{post-doctoral fellow}.
	
	I am especially interested in a position at \todo{school name} because of the opportunity to work with \todo{person(s) $1,\cdots, n$}. I am interested in studying arithmetic geometry, especially over function fields, doing explicit computations with stacks, and in differential algebra which are near current research interests of theirs. Arithmetic geometry is the main object of my PhD thesis, and that work has provided me with to tools to consider new directions in differential algebra. As I explain in my research statement the connections between these ideas open up lots of research topics. Working under the supervision of \todo{person} would allow me to explore such questions. 
	
	I would be happy to meet either in person or remotely with members of your hiring committee or other faculty from your school should my job candidacy be of interest to you.\\
