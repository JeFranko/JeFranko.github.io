<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I received my PhD in math on March 18, 2024 from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Vermont. In May 2019 I recieved a Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder with Latin honors. I spent my first year of undergrad at the Georgia Institute of Technology and then transfered to CU Boulder for my other two years.</p> 

<p>My teaching background includes gymnastics coaching for the City of Boulder, tutoring with National Honors Society in high school, yoga instruction for CorePower Yoga during college and finally my TA work at UVM, where I have been instructor of record for my courses for five years. During this time I worked as a teaching assistant at the Park City Mathematics Institute during summer 2022, a program of the Institute for Advanced Study.</p>

<p>My research projects right now are about stacks in the Drinfeld setting.</p>

<h2>Scholarship</h2>

<p>My CV includes my most notable scholarships, honors and publications in detail. On May 10, 2023 I was awarded the John F. Kenney award for excellence in mathematics by the University of Vermont Department of Mathematics and Statistics. I want to ackowledge the Keller Family and the Ryan Keller Memorial Scholarship and my first algebra instructor Dr. Richard Green, both of which parties were crucial for my academic career.</p>

<p>Recent teaching review: "I am sure that Newton, Leibniz, and many of their colleagues would not have objected to it. Lots of activity, especially for a class so early in the morning. He spoke and wrote clearly, had everything well organized, and he had good rapport with the students. As a Math 19 class, I cannot fault it."</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>I study numbers for a living, climb rocks, ski uphill both ways, read, and play games. Here is a link to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkh7pYDSo6KQcoEsg077Zig">climbing videos</a>, and maybe some day some math ones. 
</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="No_Cops_V3.pdf">link</a> to a super interesting paper about academic practice. I won't go so far as to say I completely agree with this thing in a blanket way, but it sure is thought provoking. </p>
